This is not provided through Maven transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n### This library has been successfully tested on the following platforms:\r\n* Linux desktop machine (arch: amd64 and i386) \r\n* Linux Raspberry (arch: armv6l)\r\n* Mac OS X (with hidapi provided by Homebrew)\r\n \r\n# Notes\r\n## Bug in Mac release of HidApi 0.8.0-rc1\r\n\r\nA bug in the implementation of the function hid_get_feature_report for the Mac platform is present in the release candidate\r\n0.8.0-rc1 of HidApi. This bug prevents many pieces of software (incl. jUSBRelay) to run properly.\r\n\r\n[Brew](http://brew.sh) provides a patched-version of HidApi which works properly (since April 8th, 2015).\r\n\r\nA patched version of HidApi is available on my github [HidApi fork](https://github.com/rbarazzutti/hidapi) \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2015 Raphaël P.
